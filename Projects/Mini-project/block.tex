\section{Block diagram}
The block diagram of the system is shown in \fref{Block Diagram of the system}. The soil moisture sensor placed in the soil in the field produces a digital signal representing whether soil is dry or not. This is generated by comparing moisture level and a set reference voltage. This signal is encoded and transmitted over radio.

This signal is received and decoded at a receiver setup in the home. Based on the signal received, the receiver drives a switch which actuates the relay and hence the water pump, supplying water to the field. The status of soil moisture and connectivity of the system is read by NodeMCU and updates the status on a website hosted in NodeMCU. The overall system works in a continuous feedback loop
