\section{System Identification with Noisy Output}

In a practical scenario, you might have access to a system's input $x(n)$ and its noisy output $y_{noisy}(n)$, but its impulse response $h(n)$ is unknown. A method to estimate $h(n)$ is to use cross-correlation, especially when the input is white noise.

\subsection*{Background Theory}
For an LTI system, the cross-correlation of the input and output is related to the impulse response by the convolution:
$$R_{xy}(k)=h(k) * R_{xx}(k)$$

where $R_{xx}(k)$ is the autocorrelation of the input. If the input $x(n)$ is white noise, its autocorrelation $R_{xx}(k)$ approximates a scaled impulse function:

$$R_{xx}(k) = \sigma _x ^ 2 \delta (k)$$

Therefore, $R_{xy}(k)$ will approximate a scaled version of the impulse response $h(k)$.
Hence 
\begin{align*}
	R_{xy}(k) &=h(k) * \sigma _x ^ 2 \delta (k) \\
	 &= h(k)\sigma _x ^ 2
\end{align*}

So impulse response is: 
$$h(k) = {R_{xy}(k)}{\sigma _x ^ 2}$$

to obtain $\sigma _x ^ 2$, evaluvate $R_{xx}(k)$ at $k = 0$

\underline{Question:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Create an "unknown" FIR system with some impulse response.
	\item Use the above method to obtain an estimate of this unknown impulse respones
\end{enumerate}
