\section{Multi-Band Stop FIR Filter Design}
You have a signal that is corrupted by noise at two specific frequency bands: a low-frequency hum and a high-frequency hiss.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Low-frequency hum: centered around $\omega=0.2\pi$.
	\item High-frequency hiss: centered around $\omega=0.7\pi$.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Task}: Design a single FIR filter that passes all frequencies except for those in the two specified bands.

Specifications:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Stopband 1: $[0.15\pi, 0.25\pi]$
	\item Stopband 2: $[0.65\pi, 0.75\pi]$
	\item Minimum Stopband Attenuation: 55 dB.
\end{enumerate}
