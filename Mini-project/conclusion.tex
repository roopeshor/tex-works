This project successfully demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of sensor-based automation in irrigation systems. Despite certain limitations, the system provides a foundation for sustainable and cost-effective farming practices and efficient water management.

The designed and implemented automatic irrigation system is capable of monitoring soil moisture levels and automating irrigation based on real-time data. By integrating components such as a soil moisture sensor, RF communicating modules, we created a system that responds intelligently to the soil's hydration needs. When the moisture level drops below a preset threshold, the system activates the water pump, ensuring plants receive optimal watering without manual intervention. The use of standard connectors such as USB type C make the system portable and makes it easy to use.

The system created stands as a practical example of how technology can be utilized to address real-world agricultural challenges. While future iterations could address the current limitations, the existing system already demonstrates potential for reducing manual labor and optimizing resource utilization in small-scale agricultural applications.
