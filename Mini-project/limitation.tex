\chapter{Limitations}
Currently the maximum range of stable transmission is 10 meters. This
could be further improved by proper designing of antennas. This could
also avoid cases where transmission can occasionally halt for a brief
time. Also the system can fail during precipitation due to limited
waterproofing..
