\chapter{Results \& Conclusion}
With this project we have successfully implemented an automatic
irrigation system enabling efficient water management through remote
monitoring and wireless communication. By using a soil moisture
sensor, the system monitors the moisture level of soil and supplies
water based on soil conditions. This ensures optimal plant hydration
reducing manual labour and water wastage. The system not only
optimizes water usage but also promotes sustainable growth by
preventing overwatering and underwatering.
