\chapter{Future scope}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Create an enclosure: \\
		Since the system operates in an external agricultural
		environment, exposure to    dust, soil and moisture is
		inevitable. A well sealed-enclosure prevents water damage and
		dust accumulation ensuring smooth working of sensitive components.
	\item Integrating additional sensors: \\
		Sensors such as temperature, humidity, light, pH sensors etc. can
		be helpful in optimizing irrigation based and also helps in
		gathering information about environment of farmland
	\item Remote control: \\
		If needed, the user can optionally turn on the motor remotely.
		This is useful in cases where the user has prior knowledge of
		possible power supply failure later in the day. Hence user can
		water plants in advance.
	\item Using drip irrigation and recycling of water: \\
		In  drip irrigation water is supplied to the roots of plants drop
		by drop. This can further reduce wastage of water through
		evaporation or runoff
