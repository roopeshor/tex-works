\chapter{Limitations \& Future Scope}
\section{Limitations}
Currently the maximum range of stable transmission is 10 meters. This could be further improved by proper designing of antennas. This could also avoid cases where transmission can occasionally halt for a brief time. Also the system can fail during precipitation due to limited waterproofing.
\section{Future scope}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Create an enclosure: \\
    Since the system operates in an external agricultural
    environment, exposure to    dust, soil and moisture is
    inevitable. A well sealed-enclosure prevents water damage and
    dust accumulation ensuring smooth working of sensitive components.
  \item Integrating additional sensors: \\
    Sensors such as temperature, humidity, light, pH sensors etc. can
    be helpful in optimizing irrigation based and also helps in
    gathering information about environment of farmland
  \item Remote control: \\
    If needed, the user can optionally turn on the motor remotely.
    This is useful in cases where the user has prior knowledge of
    possible power supply failure later in the day. Hence user can
    water plants in advance.
  \item Using drip irrigation and recycling of water: \\
    In  drip irrigation water is supplied to the roots of plants drop
    by drop. This can further reduce wastage of water through
    evaporation or runoff
\end{enumerate}
