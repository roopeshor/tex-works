The soil moisture sensor placed in the soil in the field produces a
digital signal representing whether soil is dry or not is generated
by comparing moisture level and a set reference voltage. This signal
is encoded and transmitted over radio. This signal is received and
decoded at a receiver setup in the home. Based on the signal
received, the receiver drives a switch which actuates the relay and
hence the water pump, supplying water to the field. The soil moisture
status is read by NodeMCU and updates the status on a website hosted in NodeMCU
