\chapter*{Abstract}

This project details the design and implementation of an automatic
irrigation system with remote monitoring, addressing the critical
need for efficient water management in agriculture. The system
consists of a Transmitter, Receiver, Soil Moisture Sensor, NodeMCU,
Encoder, Decoder, Relay and Motor. The transmitter utilizes a soil
moisture sensor to continuously monitor the moisture level of soil,
encodes and transmits the data. The receiver receives this data,
decodes and activates the motor through a relay which pumps the water
till the threshold water level is reached. This data can be accessed
through a webpage hosted by NodeMCU.
