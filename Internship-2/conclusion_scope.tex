\chapter{Conclusion}

This internship was an immensely rewarding and intensive learning experience. The successful construction and competitive performance of our autonomous drone stand as a testament to the team's dedication and skill.

I gained profound practical knowledge in drone technology, from the intricacies of electronic system integration and power management to the practical application of software like Mission Planner. The challenges, particularly the compressed timeline and component delays, improved my skills in learning, rapid problem-solving and debugging under pressure. The project also provided invaluable non-technical lessons, including the administrative complexities of international travel with technical equipment (visa and customs processes) and insights into effective team leadership observed from my team leads. The entire experience solidified my technical foundation and built my confidence in tackling large-scale, multidisciplinary engineering projects.

\chapter{Future Scope}

The project has opened up several aspects for future work.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Indigenous Component Manufacturing}:
During the travel to Mumbai for VISA process, I had a conversation with an embedded system engineer working in similar industry. He highlighted the current scenario of electronics market in India and critical need for indigenous component manufacturing for security of the nation. Inspired by this, a potential future project for me is to design and develop a domestic alternative to an imported component. I plan to focus on creating a Battery Eliminator Circuit (BEC), similar in function to the Mauch Power Cube we used. This would be a challenging as the module itself is very complex and was designed for much higher power consumption.

\item \textbf{Team and Project Continuation}:
The team plans to build on the success of this project. Our immediate goal is to participate in the upcoming NIDAR competition, hosted by Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and Drone Federation India, which will allow us to further refine our platform. Furthermore, the long-term vision is to expand the team's activities, transforming it into a hub for fostering a general engineering mindset among college students, making them more confident and industry-ready. The focus will be on encouraging innovation and hands-on product development
