\chapter{Objective of the Internship}
The primary objective of this 3-month internship at AI Aerial Dynamics was to design, develop,
and deploy a highly autonomous quadcopter to compete in the Student Unmanned Aerial Systems (SUAS) 2025 competition held in Maryland, USA.
The key technical objectives for the project were to engineer a UAV capable of:

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item Performing fully autonomous takeoff and landing.
	\item Navigating a flight path using predefined GPS waypoints.
	\item Conducting real-time aerial mapping of a designated mission area.
	\item Detecting and classifying specific ground objects from aerial imagery.
	\item Executing a precision payload drop mechanism at multiple target locations.
\end{enumerate}
\noindent
My personal objectives for this internship were:

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item To gain hands-on experience in the electronic systems integration and documentation of a complex aerial vehicle.
	\item To develop practical skills in UAV software tools and programming libraries such as Mission Planner and pymavlink.
	\item To understand the project lifecycle, from component selection and assembly to field testing and debugging under high-pressure competitive environments.
	\item To collaborate effectively within a multidisciplinary team of engineers
\end{enumerate}
